A laboratory for ethical negotiation through conversation with moral agents.

## Mission

The Fork moves beyond abstract ethical puzzles by situating decisions within concrete scenarios where you negotiate with autonomous agents embodying distinct moral frameworks. Rather than solving thought experiments, you engage in dialogues that reveal how different ethical systems reason toward different conclusions.

- thousand-tetrad.html - Multi-framework analysis

**Training Grounds**
Practice spaces for developing ethical reasoning through constrained interactions and calibration exercises.

**Railway Game**
Environmental scenarios that ground ethical decisions in concrete systems and consequences.

## Approach

Each cartridge presents a complete ethical environment. You converse with agents representing different moral traditions, observing how their reasoning processes lead to distinct choices. The focus is on understanding the journey of ethical decision-making rather than identifying correct answers.

## Operation

Open any HTML file in a web browser. No installation or dependencies required. The system runs entirely in the browser, making each cartridge immediately accessible and independently functional.

## Extension

New ethical scenarios are created by adapting existing cartridges. Each file serves as a template for exploring different moral frameworks, interaction patterns, and decision environments.

## Status

Experimental platform for ethical education and moral reasoning research.
