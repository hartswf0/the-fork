## 🔍 Overview

The Fork is a distributed research environment exploring agency, memory, ethics, and model-based negotiation across AI–human interfaces. It moves beyond abstract ethical puzzles by situating decisions within concrete scenarios where you negotiate with autonomous agents embodying distinct moral frameworks.

### 🎮 Featured Cartridge: Railway Game

**Full Integration**: [`railway-full-integration.html`](https://hartswf0.github.io/the-fork/RAILWAY%20GAME/railway-full-integration.html)  
*Requires an OpenAI API key to run agent reasoning*

---

## 🎯 Mission

To transform ethical reasoning from solitary puzzle-solving into dynamic dialogue. Rather than solving thought experiments, you engage in conversations that reveal how different ethical systems reason toward different conclusions—understanding the journey of moral decision-making rather than justifying "correct" answers.

---

## 🧪 Core Components

### Primary Interfaces
- **`fork-01.html`** - Primary ethical negotiation interface
- **`gt-fork.html`** - Game-theory forking grid
- **`thousand-tetrad.html`** - Multi-framework ethical analysis

### Training Grounds
Practice spaces for developing ethical reasoning through constrained interactions and calibration exercises.

### Scenario Cartridges
Environmental scenarios that ground ethical decisions in concrete systems and consequences.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- For Railway Game: OpenAI API key

### Running Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hartswf0/the-fork.git
cd the-fork
# Open any .html file in your browser
```

### Operation
No installation or dependencies required. Each cartridge is **immediately accessible and independently functional**—simply open any HTML file in your web browser.

---

## 💡 Philosophy & Approach

Each cartridge presents a complete ethical environment. You converse with agents representing different moral traditions, observing how their reasoning processes lead to distinct choices. The focus is on **understanding the journey** of ethical decision-making rather than identifying correct answers.

---

## 🔧 Extension & Development

Create new ethical scenarios by adapting existing cartridges:

1. **Clone a template** from the `RAILWAY GAME/` directory
2. **Modify the moral frameworks** in the agent definitions
3. **Adapt the scenario logic** using the 1000 Small Futures structure
4. **Test locally** by opening in browser
5. **Deploy** by pushing to GitHub Pages

---

## 📊 Status & Roadmap

**Current Status**: Experimental platform for ethical education and moral reasoning research.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Expand agent personality matrix
- [ ] Integrate additional memory protocols
- [ ] Develop analytics dashboard
- [ ] Create authoring toolkit for educators
- [ ] Publish research findings
