A laboratory for ethical negotiation through conversation with moral agents.

The Fork is part of a larger ecosystem of ethical engines, training substrates, and memory-remediation consoles I am building. This repo (`https://github.com/hartswf0/the-fork`) and its live deployment (`https://hartswf0.github.io/the-fork/`) include the RAILWAY GAME full integration cartridge at `https://hartswf0.github.io/the-fork/RAILWAY%20GAME/railway-full-integration.html`, which requires an OpenAI API key to run agent reasoning. The Fork draws scenario logic and branching structure from **1000 Small Futures** (`https://hartswf0.github.io/1000-small-futures/`) and from the **MEMORY REMEDIATION SYSTEM • LUMIÈRE-LUHMANN PROTOCOL V.1895** in **Synarchiv** (`https://hartswf0.github.io/synarchiv/`), in particular `https://hartswf0.github.io/synarchiv/train-brain19.html`. Related “training ground” infrastructure is developed in the **FUNCTIONAL SUBSTRATE — TRAINING GROUND INDEX** at `https://hartswf0.github.io/func-sub/func-index.html`, while new work on word assembly and “what happens when you give AI LEGOS” is explored in **TRACTOR DCE-GYO** at `https://hartswf0.github.io/tractor-dce-gyo/`. Additional ethics infrastructure for situated workplace and design negotiation lives in **Role Deck — Ethical Design Exploration & Workplace Negotiation Simulation** at `https://hartswf0.github.io/role-deck/HUB.html`. Together, these projects form a unified technical and conceptual substrate for The Fork: a distributed research environment for agency, memory, ethics, and model-based negotiation across AI–human interfaces.


## Mission

The Fork moves beyond abstract ethical puzzles by situating decisions within concrete scenarios where you negotiate with autonomous agents embodying distinct moral frameworks. Rather than solving thought experiments, you engage in dialogues that reveal how different ethical systems reason toward different conclusions.

**Core Negotiation**
- fork-01.html - Primary ethical negotiation interface
- gt-fork.html - game-theory forking grid
- thousand-tetrad.html - Multi-framework analysis

**Training Grounds**
Practice spaces for developing ethical reasoning through constrained interactions and calibration exercises.

**Railway Game**
Environmental scenarios that ground ethical decisions in concrete systems and consequences.

## Approach

Each cartridge presents a complete ethical environment. You converse with agents representing different moral traditions, observing how their reasoning processes lead to distinct choices. The focus is on understanding the journey of ethical decision-making rather than identifying correct answers.

## Operation

Open any HTML file in a web browser. No installation or dependencies required. The system runs entirely in the browser, making each cartridge immediately accessible and independently functional.

## Extension

New ethical scenarios are created by adapting existing cartridges. Each file serves as a template for exploring different moral frameworks, interaction patterns, and decision environments.

## Status

Experimental platform for ethical education and moral reasoning research.
